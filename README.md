# SCORE-Calculator
The code employs SCORE-cluster methodology developed in paper  [1]. Details and terminology can be found in the source document.
The code can take any community test data for S. mansoni (single-slide KK EPG-counts), and estimate its 'true' statistics: mean + SD (error).
Implemented  test statistics include: infection prevalence - P, geometric-mean intensity - G, graded WHO LMH-prevalence (Light-Moderate-Heavy).
The user should download 5 files (SCORE calculator.nb + SCORE normal 5-20, SCORE truth 5-20, True LMH 5-20, Sample raw data for 9 communities.csv) in the same (local) folder, open nb and follow its steps. 
The nb requires minimal Mathematica skills, easy to use. User's own test-data can be imported into nb in any data format, and quickly processed to get 'true estimates'.
